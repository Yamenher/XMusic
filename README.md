## Q&A

**Q: Is XMusic free?**  
A: Yes. Completely free. No ads, no subscriptions, no hidden nonsense.

**Q: Does XMusic require an account or internet connection?**  
A: No. Everything works fully offline and stays on your device.

**Q: Where does XMusic get my music from?**  
A: It scans local audio files stored on your device. Nothing is uploaded anywhere.

**Q: Why doesn’t XMusic show my songs?**  
A: Make sure storage permissions are granted and your audio files are in supported formats.

**Q: Does XMusic collect any personal data?**  
A: No. There is no tracking, analytics abuse, or data harvesting.

**Q: Why did playback stop in the background?** 
A: Your system’s battery optimization or OEM “power saving” probably killed it. Disable optimizations for XMusic.

A: Yes. Use GitHub Issues for bugs and feature requests, or join the Telegram community for discussion.
